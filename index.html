        <p>All practical exercises can be found on the GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/hi-srm/599">here</a>.</p>
        <p>The most up-to-date work for assessment can be found in the 'H' animation practical. I ran into a lot of trouble using Tk/Tcl and though I could get the GUI working at times, it was very buggy. This should therefore not be assessed (I don't think the problem was with my code but with my installation or the IDE I was using).</p>
        <p>Thanks!
